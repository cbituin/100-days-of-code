### Day 11: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the Music Library CLI lab for Flatiron School! 

**Thoughts:** I almost lost some momentum - a full-time job and two young ones takes a lot of energy! It's all worth it, though - including the late nights staring at code. 

**Link to work:** You're reading the main product! There's also the Flatiron lab: <a href='https://github.com/cbituin/ruby-music-library-cli-v-000' target='blank'>Music Library CLI.</a>.

### Day 12: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started new Flatiron School lab ("Tic Tac Toe with AI"); Looked through some old JS projects to see what I could revive; Reviewed repos for Operation Code to see where I could start contributing. 

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy the learning and challenge of the curriculum and the labs. Still, I find that I need some outside projects to help keep me focused and to help keep me motivated to finish faster - especially when the lab is taking a frustrating amount of time. Why not start with the organization that introduced me to formal learning, and helped get the ball rolling on my journey as a developer... thanks OPCODE!

### Day 1: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued to look through the documentation in the OpCode repos; Also read through the specs for the Flatiron School "Tic Tac Toe with AI" CLI project. 

**Thoughts:** Not a heavy <i>writing</i> code day, but I did <i>read</i> a fair amount of code. I read (and am still reading) through the documentation and codebase for OpCode, and read/still reading through the requirements and specs for my next Flatiron School project. It's important to me that I understand what needs to happen and what I need to do before I start typing until my fingers fall off. 

**Link to work:** <a href="https://github.com/cbituin/ttt-with-ai-project-v-000" target="blank">Repo to project. Still original code from fork - no updates yet.</a>
