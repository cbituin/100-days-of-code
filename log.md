### Day 1: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: UPDATES COMING SOON
<!--Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.-->

**Thoughts:** UPDATES COMING SOON
<!--I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.-->

### Day 11: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the Music Library CLI lab for Flatiron School! 

**Thoughts:** I almost lost some momentum - a full-time job and two young ones takes a lot of energy! It's all worth it, though - including the late nights staring at code. 

**Link to work:** You're reading the main product! There's also the Flatiron lab: <a href='https://github.com/cbituin/ruby-music-library-cli-v-000' target='blank'>Music Library CLI.</a>.

### Day 12: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started new Flatiron School lab ("Tic Tac Toe with AI"); Looked through some old JS projects to see what I could revive; Reviewed repos for Operation Code to see where I could start contributing. 
<!--Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.-->

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy the learning and challenge of the curriculum and the labs. Still, I find that I need some outside projects to help keep me focused and to help keep me motivated to finish faster - especially when the lab is taking a frustrating amount of time. Why not start with the organization that introduced me to formal learning, and helped get the ball rolling on my journey as a developer... thanks OPCODE!
