### Day 6: May 6, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Completed lesson on migrations in ActiveRecord. 

**Thoughts:**  A quick hour completing the lesson on Migrations in ActiveRecord. I don't have a "warm and fuzzy" feeling about migrations, so I'll be coming back to review.

### Day 5: May 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of "real" coding. Learning and a few practice exercises.

**Thoughts:**  Family sick, so family first! Still working to get some review and practice in. Took a look at a few other resources, but need to keep the momentum going on becoming a software engineer!

### Day 4: May 4, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Finished ORMs section of curriculum, and worked on ActiveRecord section. Also working with Figma to create a mockup of a project for OperationCode. 

**Thoughts:**  Making good progress so far this weekend. Had to balance working on the curriculum and taking care of two kids. In the end, I think I managed to alternate well - a little play, a little work, and repeat!

### Day 3: May 3, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Worked through a few more sections in the curriculum, and started Dynamic ORM Lab.  

**Thoughts:** Tired! It's Friday night, but no excuses! Worked through a few more lessons (that I will probably have to review again in the morning), and I started another lab assignment. I could push through, but I don't think the learning will be as effective. Clocking my hour for now, so I can live to code another day.

### Day 2: May 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: First meeting with devteam for OpCode open-source repo project done. Work through Dynamic ORMs lab via Flatiron. Played with Figma. 

**Thoughts:** Things are moving along, and I am getting more involved with actual coding. I am progressing through the Flatiron program, but I am also starting to work with some great people in the Operation Code organization. Currently working on a project to make OpCode podcasts available via the website.

**Link to work:** Not my work (yet!), but a great organization supporting Veterans in technology! OperationCode.org(https://github.com/OperationCode)

### Day 1: May 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarting 100 days of code!

**Thoughts:** Was not as successful last go around, but this time I've got more momentum! I've progressed a bit in my Flatiron School program, so I am able to work on more projects. In addition, I am working on an open source project with Operation Code! I'll add more details soon, but exciting times ahead!

For actual coding time, worked through ORM lab via Flatiron. Moving on to Dynamic ORMs!

### Day 11: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the Music Library CLI lab for Flatiron School! 

**Thoughts:** I almost lost some momentum - a full-time job and two young ones takes a lot of energy! It's all worth it, though - including the late nights staring at code. 

**Link to work:** You're reading the main product! There's also the Flatiron lab: <a href='https://github.com/cbituin/ruby-music-library-cli-v-000' target='blank'>Music Library CLI.</a>.

### Day 12: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started new Flatiron School lab ("Tic Tac Toe with AI"); Looked through some old JS projects to see what I could revive; Reviewed repos for Operation Code to see where I could start contributing. 

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy the learning and challenge of the curriculum and the labs. Still, I find that I need some outside projects to help keep me focused and to help keep me motivated to finish faster - especially when the lab is taking a frustrating amount of time. Why not start with the organization that introduced me to formal learning, and helped get the ball rolling on my journey as a developer... thanks OPCODE!

### Day 13: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued to look through the documentation in the OpCode repos; Also read through the specs for the Flatiron School "Tic Tac Toe with AI" CLI project. 

**Thoughts:** Not a heavy <i>writing</i> code day, but I did <i>read</i> a fair amount of code. I read (and am still reading) through the documentation and codebase for OpCode, and read/still reading through the requirements and specs for my next Flatiron School project. It's important to me that I understand what needs to happen and what I need to do before I start typing until my fingers fall off.

### Day 14: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on TTT CLI project.

**Thoughts:** Not the most productive day, but every little bit counts!

### Day 15: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of progress today. Completed over half of the CLI lab, and helped a peer work through a method from a  previous project. 

**Thoughts:** Although parts of this lab were completed in other sections of the Flatiron School curriculum, I decided to start from a blank slate. I wanted to see how much I've learned, and I wanted to understand how I interpret specs and think about the code I am about to write. I felt good about what I was writing, and I went a lot further than I thought I would. I looked back on my old code for similar class/instance methods... and wow! Definitely seeing some progress!

### Day 16: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Another day done. Not a lot of progress made, but I'm sticking with it!

**Thoughts:** Revisited my code and tried to clean a few things up. I didn't have a lot of time to dig deep into the CLI app, but I am keeping up the habit! I also set up my local environment to work on a simple PR for some updates to the OpCode documentation.

### Day 18: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on instance method from inherited class within CLI app.

**Thoughts:** Made some progress in the CLI lab, but trying to troubleshoot the issue with my current instance method. Busy work week, so I could only put in the minimum hour. Have to stay committed!

### Day 19: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on instance method from inherited class within CLI app.

**Thoughts:** Still working through this method. A little frustrated at this point, but I want to take the time to understand what is going on with this method!

### Day 20: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on instance method from inherited class within CLI app.

**Thoughts:** STILL on the same method. Trying to research errors related to IO. Continuing to receive ERRNO / ENOENT for my #gets method. Going to dig in deeper to figure out how to resolve.

### Day 21: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally worked through previous issue with the instance method. Currently working through the method that controls user input.

**Thoughts:** FINALLY figured out the issue. #gets was not intended to be used where I attempted to use it. Original issue ended up being an issue involving recursion in my methods. Cleaned it up, and moved on to the next specs!

### Day 22: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working through instance method for CLI App.

**Thoughts:** While troubleshooting, I was able to refactor 12 lines of code into two; however, I am still working through an issue with the data that is returned.

### Day 23: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Moving on to CLI interface!

**Thoughts:** Finally moving on to configuring the CLI interface, and creating the user interaction elements. As I was troubleshooting my previous issues with the methods involved, I realized I had to work backwards a few methods. It turns out that the two class methods prior to the class method I was troubleshooting (because recursion) were not providing the correct return values. This led to the "troubled" class method not returning the correct value because it wasn't accepting a correct value in the first place. 

Now, all specs have passed and all there is left to do is to create the interactive side of the CLI app!

### Day 24: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Attempted to refactor codebase.

**Thoughts:** Not a very productive day - I attempted to refactor the code I had, but didn't really make any changes. At least I have a better grasp of my methods and what is going on in my code!

### Day 25: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** CLI started.

**Thoughts:** I started to work on the interactions today. Struggling through remembering how to call various methods within the classes, and in what order to put them in. Also working through 'game rules' and implementing game logic within /bin.

### Day 01: February 06, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started on Student Scraper project on Learn.Co. Restarted #100daysofcode challenge.

**Thoughts:** Life happens(happened/is happening)! With two kids under three and a full-time+ job, time got away from me. It's been nearly a week since I could get an hour or more of work done on projects/lessons. After getting 25% of the way through the challenge, I have started over. I have a good feeling about this iteration, though. The previous iteration helped me get into a groove, and it taught me a few lessons about time management in regard to development and side projects. Here's to making it to 100 days!
